# **Metrocar Funnel Analysis: A Strategic Exploration to Enhance Customer Experience and Operational Efficiency**

In this comprehensive study, I worked with Metrocar, a ride-sharing service, to scrutinize its service efficiency and customer engagement. The focus was on dissecting the customer journey through various service stages and understanding the impact of waiting times on service satisfaction. We aimed to pinpoint operational bottlenecks and devise strategies to enhance overall service quality, particularly optimizing ride allocation and reducing customer waiting times.
